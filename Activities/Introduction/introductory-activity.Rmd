Introductory Activity
========================================================

Break into groups of approximately 3 people. 
* Introduce yourselves and find out enough about your group-mates that you can introduce them.  


After the introductions, you'll reconvene in your groups and carry out these assignments:

1. Discuss one of these two topics
  * Why do you teach calculus?  What are your goals?
  * Students by and large take calculus because they are required to or because they have been told to.  What are the good reasons why students should take calculus?  What should they be getting out of the course: what concepts, what skills?
2. Make a list of the basic functions that students should learn in calculus.
    * For each function, give two settings where that function is important:
        * Within calculus
        * Ouside of calculus, e.g. in applications
    * Think of your functions as parameterized families of functions.  
        * Write down a parameterization for each family of functions.
        * Give a reasonable alternative parameterization.
        * Explain your choice of one 
        parameterization over another. What operations does one make easier than 
        the other?
