### Exponentials

#### Consensus

**To be determined**

Example:
* Use $t$ as the dependent variable
* Use $A$ as the "amplitude" : magnitude at time $t=0$

#### Candidates

-----

• $A \exp(k t) + C$


###### Justification

* Relates well to differential equations.
* Models exponential decay to a fixed point
* Parameter $k$ not too hard to eye-ball --- use the half-life doubling time $\tau$ and set $k = \ln(2)/\tau$


###### Disadvantages

-----

• ${A (1+r)^t}$

###### Justification

* Bank interest rate format
* For $r$ in typical bank rate range (say, -15 to 15 percent), doubling-time/half-life is well approximated by the "Rule of 72": $\tau = 72/r$ with $r$ in percent.

-----

• $A 2^{t/\tau}$

* Parameter easy-to-estimate
