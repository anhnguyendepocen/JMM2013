Taylor Polynomials vs Least Squares Fits
========================================================

This interactive applet can be used (if you are in RStudio) to investigate the differences between Taylor Polynomial and Least Squares approximations to functions.
```{r,include=FALSE}
require(mosaic)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
fetchData("mTaylor.R")
mTaylor(exp(-0.2 * x) * sin(x) ~ x, xlim = c(0, 10))
```

One could also study other measures of fit, like MISE (mean integrated squared error), or
its square root (RMS).
