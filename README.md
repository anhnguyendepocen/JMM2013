Description
------------
This one-day workshop is designed to help instructors move toward teaching introductory calculus in a modeling- and data-oriented way. The parameters of basic functions are often treated casually in introductory calculus, as if they were a nuisance or merely fodder for the chain rule. In the first half of the workshop, we'll show how to interpret them physically, how to relate them to data, and how to use them for model building. The second half emphasizes polynomial approximation, the relationship between Taylor series and model fitting, and model building using information about derivatives. A small, general purpose mathematical toolkit suffices to build and interpret compelling models in a very wide range of settings spanning economics, biology, physics, etc. We'll provide in-class activities, assignments, student project topics, and example exam questions. Both paper-and-pencil as well as computer-oriented approaches (using R, Sage, or Mathematica) will be featured, drawing on the materials developed through the NSF-supported Project MOSAIC, which aims to construct strong connections in teaching modeling, calculus, statistics, and computation. Participants are encouraged to bring a laptop. If you don't currently use software for teaching calculus, we'll set you up with the free R system running through a web browser.
