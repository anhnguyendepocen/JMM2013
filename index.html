        <h2>Functions, Parameters and Fitting for Teaching Calculus</h2>

<p><strong>Date</strong>: Tuesday, January 8th, 2013; 9:00am - 4:00pm</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong>: <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/maps/travel/sandt-san-diego-marriott-marquis-and-marina/">Marriott Marquis San Diego</a> in the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotelwebsites/us/s/sandt/SANDT_PDF/SANDT%20All-FloorDiagram2012-Color.pdf">Carlsbad/Cardiff Rooms</a>: South Tower --- Level 3</p>

<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>This page is our interface to next Tuesday's workshop.  It's just intended to give you a bit of information before the workshop.  We'll be publishing all the materials from the workshop online, but not until the workshop actually happens!</p>

<h3>Preparing for the Workshop</h3>

<p>This will be a hands-on workshop.  Some of the activities can be accomplished with paper and pencil, but others require a computer.  We'll provide paper and pens, but we can't provide computers!  So you will have to bring your own.  We'll provide the software.</p>

<h4>Computers</h4>

<p>If at all possible, please bring a laptop with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> to the workshop.  Make sure that your laptop has a reasonably up-to-date web browser installed: Firefox, Safari, and/or Chrome will work well.</p>

<h5>The Minimal Configuration</h5>

<p>This is intended to be very simple ... you won't have to do any setup before the workshop.</p>

<p>We will be setting up a server at the workshop to provide a complete set of software, web pages, etc.  You will not need to have an Internet connection --- you'll just connect to the wireless intranet that we will be setting up.  Instructions will be given at the workshop.</p>

<h5>Your Own Mathematics Software</h5>

<p>Our objective for the workshop is to provide you with ideas and materials you can take away to use in your own calculus course.  If you already use software in your course such as Mathematica, Maple, MATLAB, SAGE, etc, you're welcome to use that familiar software in the workshop. </p>

<p>Make sure that whatever software you use is configured so that you can run it without an Internet connection.  (Alternatively, you can purchase Internet connectivity at the conference hotel.)</p>

<p>Also, to be able to use the data files we will provide, check your documentation to see how to read a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file into your software.</p>

<h5>R Software</h5>

<p>We'll be using the R package in the examples that we present.  Even if you don't use R yourself, we encourage you to try it out during the workshop; you don't need to have any previous experience with it.</p>

<p>We'll provide an R server through Wi-Fi, so you need do nothing to set up R on your computer. </p>

<p>If you're already an R user, and you want to use R on your own computer,</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure to update the <a href="http://www.r-project.org">R package</a> to a recent version, e.g. 2.15. </li>
<li>Install the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com">RStudio desktop graphical user interface</a>
</li>
<li>Install the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/index.html"><code>mosaic</code> package</a>.</li>
</ul><p>Make sure to do this <strong>while you still have Internet</strong>, before the workshop!</p>

<h4>Calculus</h4>

<p>As you are on your way to the workshop, think about these two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Why are you teaching calculus?  What are your own goals?</li>
<li>Students by and large take calculus because they are required to or because they have been told to.  What are the good reasons why students should take calculus?  What should they be getting out of the course: what concepts, what skills?</li>
</ol><p>Also, insofar as you have time, make a list of the basic functions that students should learn in calculus.</p>

<ul>
<li>For each function, give two settings where that function is important:

<ol>
<li>Within calculus</li>
<li>Ouside of calculus, e.g. in applications</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Think of your functions as parameterized families of functions.<br><ol>
<li>What parameters should be used?</li>
<li>Give a reasonable alternative parameterization.</li>
<li>Explain your choice of one parameterization over the other. What operations does one make easier than the other?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul><h3>Agenda for the Workshop</h3>
