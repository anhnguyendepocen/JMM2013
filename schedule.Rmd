Functions, Parameters, and Fitting for Teaching Calculus
========================================================

**Date**: Tuesday, January 8th, 2013; 9:00am - 4:00pm

**Location**: [Marriott Marquis San Diego](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/maps/travel/sandt-san-diego-marriott-marquis-and-marina/) in the [Carlsbad/Cardiff Rooms](http://www.marriott.com/hotelwebsites/us/s/sandt/SANDT_PDF/SANDT%20All-FloorDiagram2012-Color.pdf): South Tower --- Level 3

#### [Description](http://www.causeweb.org/workshop/jmm13_mosaic/)

> This one-day workshop is designed to help instructors move toward teaching introductory calculus in a modeling- and data-oriented way. The parameters of basic functions are often treated casually in introductory calculus, as if they were a nuisance or merely fodder for the chain rule. In the first half of the workshop, we'll show how to interpret them physically, how to relate them to data, and how to use them for model building. The second half emphasizes polynomial approximation, the relationship between Taylor series and model fitting, and model building using information about derivatives. A small, general purpose mathematical toolkit suffices to build and interpret compelling models in a very wide range of settings spanning economics, biology, physics, etc. We'll provide in-class activities, assignments, student project topics, and example exam questions. Both paper-and-pencil as well as computer-oriented approaches (using R, Sage, or Mathematica) will be featured, drawing on the materials developed through the NSF-supported Project MOSAIC, which aims to construct strong connections in teaching modeling, calculus, statistics, and computation. Participants are encouraged to bring a laptop. If you don't currently use software for teaching calculus, we'll set you up with the free R system running through a web browser.

## Schedule and Outline

Workshop = Work + Shop

Outline of the day: Four themes

 1. Anatomy of a (Mathematical) Model
 2. Models and Calculus (What does Calculus tell me about my model?)
 3. Fitting Models (How do I use data?)
 4. Model Creation (What model(s) should I fit?)

 
We'll divide the day up into 4 sessions with approximately this schedule:

 * 9-10:15  Session 1
 * 10:15-10:30  Break
 * 10:30-11:45  Session 2
 * 11:45-1:15  Lunch at the Marina Kitchen in the Marriott.  Free to participants.
 * 1:10-2:30  Session 3
 * 2:30-2:45  Break
 * 2:45-4:00  Session 4
 
### Introduction

  What is a model?  What is modeling?
  
### Anatomy of a Model: Functions and Parameters

[Introduction](Notes/Introduction.html)

[Introductory activity](Activities/Introduction/introductory-activity.html) (15 min) 

#### Interactive: Technology: Accessing the web server and RStudio (15 min) 

* Introduction to enough R to let them load and plot data
    * `fetchData()`
    * `plotPoints()`
    * Assignment with `=` or `<-`
    
#### Compiling the list of functions and parameterizations (15 min) 

At this point, just enter the forms, without much discussion.  

Use R Markdown to record these live and to demo how R Markdown works.

#### ACTIVITY: [Eyeballing Parameters](Notes/Eyeballing-Parameters.html) (20 min)

* Load in the data files and find the parameters.  Data files illustrate several of the function types:

### Summary
Create and display a document summarizing the findings.  

* A template document on [Calculus Functions and their Parameters](functions-parameters.html)

### Calculus and Models

###### Differentiation 

1. Find the flow [from PREP 2012](http://prep2012.mosaic-web.org/Topics/OrangeJuiceFlow/OrangeJuice.html)
2. [Linear and Quadratic approximations via derivatives](Notes/Derivs-and-Approximations.html). **TO DO: put `slideX0` in `fetchData()` repository
3. Curvature

###### Integration 

1. Given the flow, find the volume.  (From StartR)
2. RMS approximation.  Showing that the constant approx is not as good as the linear is not as good as the quadratic. (See final part of [linear and quadratic appoximations](Notes/Derivs-and-Approximations.html))

  * **TO DO** Write a function that fits a function form to a given $f(x)$ using least squares.  Have it sample $f(x)$ on a given range.
