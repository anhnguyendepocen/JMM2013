### Images

For an inserted image, put a non-breaking space after the paragraph.  That will suppress the figure environment.  Or, we might want to redefine the figure environment and caption in order to get what we want.

### Title

Put this information at the top of the document, e.g.

% This is the title
% Author 1; Author 2
